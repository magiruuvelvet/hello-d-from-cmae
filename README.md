# Hello D from CMake

Simple test to use CMake with D.

**Dependencies**:

 - https://github.com/magiruuvelvet/gentoo-overlay/tree/master/dev-util/cmake-d (package for https://github.com/dcarp/cmake-d)


In real world applications those CMake files should be added to the project source though,
because nobody is gonna install those modules globally on their system.
