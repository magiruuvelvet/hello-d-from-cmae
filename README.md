# Hello D from CMake

Learning D as C++20 programmer and using CMake for building.

~~**Dependencies**:~~

 - ~~https://github.com/magiruuvelvet/gentoo-overlay/tree/master/dev-util/cmake-d (package for https://github.com/dcarp/cmake-d)~~


~~In real world applications those CMake files should be added to the project source though,~~
~~because nobody is gonna install those modules globally on their system.~~

Superseded using CMake module magic, It worked on my machine even after uninstalling the modules from the system.

# What is this repo?

```d
/**
 * Decided to learn D. No plans yet to use it for an application.
 * In this example I try to figure out how D manages memory by
 * reading the docs and getting my hands dirty with some tests,
 * and compare it to the C++ RAII.
 *
 * Also experimenting with C and C++ interoperability by directly
 * linking the foreign language objects into the same binary.
 * No plans to try dynamic loading yet.
 *
 * I know D has a package manager, but I like CMake and git submodules :)
 * If I ever do a real D project, don't expect that I use dub for this.

## My comparisons of what I figured out so far

I made this table mainly for myself as cheat sheet.

`*ยน`: The programming language doesn't force you to use a specific ecosystem like *cough*Go*cough*.

<br>

About **Modules**: you can freely access `private` class/struct members inside the same module which declared it.
Watch out for stupid bugs, because the compiler didn't yell about `private`. This feature is supposed to make
C++ `friend` keyword obsolete, but also can be dangerous if not paying attention. I may or may not like it.

I yet need to figure out more about D's memory management. On things I'm unsure or I still
need to learn/figure out I added a `??`. Table is not complete yet.
